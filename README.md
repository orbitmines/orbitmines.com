*A public repository for [orbitmines.com](https://orbitmines.com). The hub for OrbitMines' (research) projects.*

*Once a Minecraft server, now a research project dedicated to understanding arbitrarily unknown dynamical systems.*

**What is this?, What is OrbitMines?, What are Rays?**

A simple way of phrasing this, is that the concept of a (hyper-/)'Vertex', (hyper-/)'Edge', (hyper-/)'Graph', (hyper-/)'Rule', (hyper-/)'Tactic', (hyper-/)..., (hyper-/)'Rewrite' are merged into one thing: a [Ray](https://github.com/orbitmines/orbitmines.com/blob/main/src/%40orbitmines/explorer/Ray.ts). It handles surrounding context, ignorances, equivalences, ..., differentiation. (And if it cannot, then it offers a way of implementing it for all of the above)
