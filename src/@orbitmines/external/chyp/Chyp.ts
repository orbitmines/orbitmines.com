/**
 * An interface from Aleks Kissinger's [Chyp (Cospans of HYPergraphs)](https://github.com/akissinger/chyp) to (OrbitMines') Rays.
 *
 * **What is this?, What are Rays?**
 *
 * See the `README.md` at [github.com/orbitmines/orbitmines.com](https://github.com/orbitmines/orbitmines.com). Or locally: [README.md](../../../../README.md)
 *
 * **Why is this interface here?**
 *
 * Note that this is mainly here for reference to the existing Chyp codebase - for anyone who understands that structure, to quickly translate that knowledge into how Rays work. - Other than that functionality, everything here should be considered as deprecated. Or considered as a legacy translation, which will be accessibly through OrbitMines.
