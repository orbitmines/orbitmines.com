/**
 * The law, on the page — and behind each equation, where it came from.
 *
 * It is also in the headers of `gravity.ts` and `metric.tsx`, and the reason it
 * is here as well is that a reader of the article is not a reader of the
 * source. `GRAIN` is read from `gravity.ts` rather than restated, so there is
 * no second copy of a number to drift.
 *
 * Set rather than drawn: there is no maths library in this repository and the
 * article has a PDF path, so the notation is built out of flex boxes and a
 * border for the rule. Which is enough — a fraction is a numerator over a
 * denominator with a line between. Variables lean, the lattice's own counts
 * stand upright and are coloured, so a reader can see at a glance which
 * symbols are quantities and which are the model's constants.
 *
 * EVERY DERIVED EQUATION OPENS. Which is the point of the section: a model
 * whose constants are all counts and a model with six fitted parameters look
 * identical once they are drawn, and the only way to tell them apart is to be
 * able to ask any line where it came from and get an answer.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS ON THIS PAGE ARE MEASURED and every one of them is reproducible
 * from `models.ts` — the sixths, the deflection, the a and e of each orbit.
 * They are quoted here rather than computed here, which is a second copy and
 * therefore a thing that can drift; `GRAIN` is imported instead, and the rest
 * would be too if the panels were cheap enough to run at render.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, since a reader who saw this page before will notice. It used
 * to end by owning up: a sixth of Mercury's perihelion, half of light's
 * deflection, and the missing part named as a spatial metric "this keeps one
 * number per place, and cannot say it". That was wrong twice over. The one
 * sixth was the FORCE LAW's, not A's — A alone, taken as a metric, gives four
 * sixths — and one number per place says it perfectly well, because the
 * spatial part at this order is a scalar. What was missing was not a second
 * field but the second READING of the count already being taken. See `METRIC`.

      An annihilation removes the two points its charges were on and joins what
      was behind each onto what was behind the other. So the place it happened
      is left with more space folded into it than its neighbours have.
    </Step>

    <Because>what that does to a path through it</Because>
    <Step eq={<>
      <Frac over={<>1 + <V>n</V></>} under={<>1, and there are <K>WAYS</K> of them</>} />
    </>}>
      A path arriving there has more ways of going the way the annihilation
      went than of going any other. One makes it two to one, a second three to
      one, a third four — the direction accumulates weight one annihilation at
      a time, while every other way out of the point still weighs exactly what
      it always did. There are <K>WAYS</K> = 26 of those.
    </Step>

    <Step eq={<><K>BIAS</K> = <Frac over={<K>LIGHT</K>} under={<K>WAYS</K>} /></>}>
      So the net lean is <K>LIGHT</K>·<V>n</V>/<K>WAYS</K> — linear in the
      count, with no ceiling in it — and one annihilation is worth <K>BIAS</K>.
      This is the only constant in the dynamics, and it is a ratio of two
      counts.
    </Step>

    <Because>that is a ratio, and a ratio is not all of it</Because>

      <b style={{ color: INK }}>a point with more ways out of it holds more

      1 − 2<V>u</V> + 2<V>u</V><Sup>2</Sup> and 1 + 2<V>u</V>, and they carry
      the <i>same</i> <V>u</V> with the same coefficient — which is not a
      choice, it is the statement that a point’s lean and a point’s thickness
      are one event seen twice. Written closed rather than as the series
      because <V>A</V>/<V>B</V> is then at most one, so the ceiling{' '}

      The counting happens on the body’s own worldline, so{' '}
      <K>LIGHT</K>·<V>n</V>/<K>WAYS</K> is cells per tick of <i>its</i> clock —
      a proper velocity, not a coordinate one. Turning that into what the

      and how many cells it is worth depends on how thick the place is. Flat, it
      is <B>u</B>/√(1 + |<B>u</B>|<Sup>2</Sup>) exactly as before. Nothing is

      A body’s count grows by <K>BIAS</K>·<V>S</V> divided by its own mass —
      the <i>fraction</i> of its paths that were bent, since its path count is
      its mass. Multiply back through and the mass cancels out of the statement
      entirely. <i>carry</i> is what one meeting is worth where it happened,
      and it is one wherever nothing is going on; at leading order it is

      <b style={{ color: INK }}>One thing, and it is in the lattice rather than

      lattice that is consume-ahead-emit-behind — measured, an exact swap that
      displaces nothing net. Whether it can carry a surplus outward at{' '}
      <V>D</V> ≈ 3.4 steps² a tick is a question about that rule, not a new
      one. Until it is answered, <V>D</V> is a number the continuum needs and
      the lattice has not been shown to supply.

    <Note>
      Two things bound whatever answers it. An ambient charge{' '}

      <V>λ</V> = <V>c</V>/(<K>BITE</K>·share·<V>Φ</V><Sub>0</Sub>) and gravity
      becomes Yukawa with that range — cluster scale needs{' '}

      <b style={{ color: INK }}>cannot take back</b> what it emits: measured on
      a running lattice, at most two parts in a thousand return, because a
