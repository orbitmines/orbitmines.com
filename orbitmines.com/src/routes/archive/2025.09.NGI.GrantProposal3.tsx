        At some point in the future, programming languages will have to evolve to be something not *just* text-based. Something which is more fluid and can combine the traditional text-based interfaces with more interactive interfaces. This project is a text-based programming language in anticipation of that future. So in one sentence: A programming language with the syntax of Python, with the functionality of Lean, and interactivity of the Wolfram Language.

        <BR/>

        Currently, I have a triplet of files which contain all design notes regarding the language - some 2000 lines long -: (the two files here https://github.com/orbitmines/ray/tree/main/ar.ray/ray.ray.txt and https://github.com/orbitmines/ray/blob/main/ar.ray/ray.ts/src/ray.ts).

        <BR/>

        The project at the start will be implementing all those notes within the syntax of the language. Then writing a compiler and runtime. Then working on the ecosystem for interactivity.

        <BR/>

        If at the end of this project I can start working on an IDE (as the next project) in the language itself. I'd consider it a success.

        I have not been involved with other projects related to this project before. Except for a minor bug-fix, this is the first time I'm contributing to an open source project.

        Other than my own, the project has no other funding sources.

        <BR/>

        The budget will be used to sustain myself for over a year to work on the project. A breakdown would be an estimate of 2.000 € /month. So x12 = 24.000 €.

      <Section head="Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts." sub="(e.g. what is new, more thorough or otherwise different)">
        Back in 2023 I spent two months studying many existing projects (https://github.com/orbitmines/library/blob/main/phases/Project%20Index.md) in the space of programming languages and theorem-provers.
        <BR/>
        There are several design patterns which exist in other languages, but no solution exists which combines all of them:
        <BR/>
        (1) By design there's some overlap with languages like Python, Ruby and TypeScript in the ways of syntax.
        <BR/>
        (2) Languages like Agda, Lean, ... Idris implement features like dependent types, higher inductive types, types like "this function terminates" and (interactive) theorem proving. Though there's overlap there, to my knowledge no language exists which treats all objects as spaces like graphs (though higher inductive types are a step in that direction).
        <BR/>
        (3) Barely any interactive theorem provers exist like Chyp (https://github.com/akissinger/chyp) or the ZX-calculus theorem provers, which are based on a form of (hyper)graph rewriting.
        <BR/>
        (4) The ability to use abstract interpretation directly in the language. This is always only reserved for the compiler implementation of the language and not exposed to the language. (An example of this might be calling a function which accepts a number with a range of numbers)
        <BR/>
        (5) Similarly, compilers and something like Lean, have proofs of equivalence of functions. But there's no native support for saying "this function can be implemented in these ways" let the compiler choose one it thinks is better. (Say one implementation for the specification, another for efficiency) An example of what having that enabled in the .ray.txt language: recursively defining all boolean operations in terms of each-other, then telling the compiler: "There are multiple ways in which you can implement all boolean operations, based on the system you're compiling to you can choose how to whether to implement them or use some primitive."
        <BR/>
        (6) As for interactivity with a programming language (which would be the next step in the evolution of this programming language). Something like the Wolfram Language is a canonical example of possibilities in that space.
      </Section>
      <Section head="What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?)" sub="(optional but recommended)">
        (1) One of the big challenges is a design problem: How do you intuitively encode a structure like a (hyper)graph in text-based format. - In order to define types which are some form of a hypergraph. (This will likely be some form of recursive definition like inductive types/enums)
        <BR/>
        (2) Another technical challenge is the building of the compiler; to something like JavaScript (for running in the browser), C++ or directly integrating with compiler technology like LLVM. As it is the first time I'm doing something like this, figuring that out will be a challenge.
        <BR/>
        (3) As working with theorem provers is quite new to me, implementing that functionality into the language will be a challenge. (As is working with proofs in possibly infinite spaces)
        <BR/>
        (4) Since the whole language is based on hypergraphs: The technical challenge of writing some of the algorithms for working with hypergraphs.
        <BR/>
        (5) One feature of the interactive theorem prover I'd like, and part of language called function intensionality (so checking whether the implementations of two functions mean the same thing) is something I'm still unsure about how to implement.
      </Section>
      <Section head="Describe the ecosystem of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?" sub="(E.g. which actors will you involve? Who should run or deploy your solution to make it a success?)">
        Like any programming language the ecosystem will require a package manager once people start using it, but initially this is not a requirement for setting up the project.

        <BR/>
        It will at the start be a game of getting programming language enthusiasts interested in the language. It'll be similar yet different enough from existing programming languages that it should spike some interest. So a start of posting it on forums and seeing if there's interest is a start.

        <BR/>
        Once the text-based programming language is in place, a big part of the ecosystem will be a custom IDE/and IntelliJ/VS Code plugins built on top of it. Which will provide the basis for its future ecosystem: A move away from only being a text-based programming language.
