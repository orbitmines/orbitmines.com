        <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>It begins with a slightly unusual way of (visual) thinking. Usually, when one wants to describe some <span

        Clear enough, this could represent any (single) thing. Quite useful, like any abstraction, but there's something
        incredibly easy to ignore - or miss, that it could be a possible question to ask.

        <BR/>

        Imagine a line going from your eyes through this point. Now I could say that the point is no longer the point it
        was before, it has become part of another structure: The line you just imagined. The easy thing to miss being,
        that this was already the case. In order to - point out - this point, you had already constructed this line. It
        was simply ignored, it was simply deemed irrelevant.

        This is in short, what this string of text is about. Things, ignored context, and a slightly different way of
        thinking about them.

        <BR/>

        It's quite likely that these ideas are the culmination of having abstracted so far, - blurred together so many
        concepts -, that it might not be too obvious why thinking along these lines could be useful. Allow me to take
        you through this wilderness, and perhaps we might discover something of interest:

        <span
          className="bp5-text-disabled" style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>For the more inexperienced reader: The important thing in this text, are the visuals. If you understand the visuals, you understand what I'm trying to say. It's perfectly fine not to understand all the sentences in detail.</span>

    <Arc head="Arc: A Visual Introduction to Rays">
      Let's slowly take apart why that example might be a gateway into an incredibly complicated world. Take for instance, that point, but visualized in this unusual way.

      </Block>

      <BR/>

      From the perspective of the visualization, you could think of it this way: I don't know exactly what this point is or how I know about it, but I have a way to 'point' to it. But this isn't quite enough. You might like to say more about its structure - or what that thing is.

      <Section head="On Continuations" sub="Constructing Continuations - Continuations as Equivalence">
        <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>Consider the following: If I have a way of pointing to some node. I could take that pointer and ask: What if there were more points in that direction? This could mean quite a few things. <span className="bp5-text-muted">Whether there's additional points behind the point, or between my eyes and the point. Whether I mean a(n) array, set, line, path, hyperedge, collection, ..., list.</span> As a way of saying: "Whenever I have 'one' of something, I can always say: What if I had more of that thing?".</span>

        <BR/>

        This raises several questions. (1) How do you even construct a continuation like that? (2) What does it mean for a continuation to go in a loop? (3) What does it mean to have something in between two points?, ...

        <BR/>

        There's already something we could say about continuing a line, even without much rigor on how to actually construct it. Say we have two points,

        But it's not entirely obvious what one even means by that. Let's already assume I have something with which I can construct a line like that. I could say that the two points I'm interested in regarding as "the same" are on a line.

        This more abstractly, is just the same thing as we did above. We're just adding equivalences on continuations. What makes it different is the context defined around it. Hence, we get something which looks more like branching, even though they can be abstractly realized as the same kind of thing.

        ago {OnIntelligibilityReference}. There's one thing in particular that stands out. If I have one thing and I
        make a perfect copy. Surely I now have two things which are perfectly "the same", right? The idea being that, if
        you can even point and say that there are "two things" and you can distinguish between them. That shows exactly
        at least one way in which they are not the same. And if you'd like to be able to say they are "the same" - you
        need to ignore that difference.

        <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>Alright, this might start to give you an impression. But let's keep expanding on this kind of idea. What I'm basically saying here, is that in order to point out some <span
          className="bp5-text-muted">symmetry, invariance, ..., equivalence</span>, I need access to some <span
          className="bp5-text-muted">asymmetry, variance, ..., inconsistency</span>. Or again this thing of, in order to point out some way in which they're the same, I need access to some way in which they're not. Or slightly rephrased; if I cannot see a difference, it will look the same to me.</span>

        <BR/>

        <span className="bp5-text-muted" style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>An example of this might be a tautology. A tautology doesn't generally hold up. In setting up a tautology, there must be an asymmetry in order for me to point out which two things are supposed to represent the same thing. The reason why that doesn't matter for most things considered tautologies, is that this inconsistency is just deemed an irrelevant detail. This asymmetry can be ignored. And hence, if we allow for the ignorance of this difference, a tautology holds: "of course they are the same" - if you ignore the difference, that is.</span>

        <BR/>

        <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>It's quite easy (in general) from either perspective, to ask what it would mean to change perspective, as it were. Since changing perspective is just <span
          className="bp5-text-muted">adding, removing, ..., changing</span> structure. From the perspective which only sees a binary number, we could ask: "What if I saw this thing as three possible options?"</span>

        I could say, "oh, the one is red, the other is blue", and they must be *the same kind* of red and blue. And so surely, if we ignore the difference between the two, that could be interpreted as a superposition.

        This could frankly be anything. If it can be constructed, this is valid way of equivalencing the two. So this,

        The problem with a loop being, that in order to remain consistent. Anything found at the point must never
        change. You cannot distinguish between each iteration of the loop - there must be no asymmetry on each
        iteration.

        <BR/>

        But it's much worse than that. Take for instance an infinite line of a selected binary number.

        But like this, we don't really have access to say the added point is "in between" our other two points, we just
        have three points. One way of thinking about it, is that we want two ways of describing the same thing. One
        which means our usual two points, and the other, us asking what's "in between" them.

        Among the many possible ways of doing this, one could be to draw equivalences between points (and depending on

        Probably the reason why one usually doesn't ask what's between two fractions, is that this question is already
        self-referentially answered. And deemed "not interesting". As a way of saying: "You can always keep asking what
        is between two points, and that answer is always the same." <Reference is="footnote" index={referenceCounter()}>Though,
        you could say something interesting as, the first 100 decimals places are this kind of fractal expansion, the
        next 60 this kind, and any arbitrary thing that follows this other kind. - Quite funky constructions can be
        made, but are probably usually ignored for a simpler pattern like this.</Reference>. Which is an example of how

        Note that this is the idea behind something continuous/continuity. A simple, likely inconsistent loop which holds, or merely the inability to even ask the question of what's in between two things, infinitely.

        Quite similar to fractals (or any concept really). We could say that movement and teleporting are the same kind

        I need to be able to say from the perspective of teleporting: This would've been the slower path. And from the
        perspective of moving: This teleported me across the distance I otherwise needed to slowly move through. - If I
        can't, they're the same thing.

        <BR/>

        But either way, they're more abstractly just the same thing. We're just moving along some (possibly more
        complicated) path.

        <BR/>

        <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>This concept is quite generalizable. We can say the same thing for <span className="bp5-text-muted">local/non-local, linear/non-linear, close/distant, ..., trivial/non-trivial</span>.

        Quite obviously, if I didn't know which one, I would need additional information to distinguish between them.

        <BR/>

        Suddenly a concept like entropy becomes entirely clear: Just visualize the compressor and possibly the order (or more generally: the structure) in which information is received, as additional structure. Necessarily, that (relative) structure is additional information. Necessarily, certain things are easier with, or easier without those structures.

        What I think this will turn out to be; Is that in the process of trying to understand programming languages, compilation and compression. That I ended up abstracting so far away from them. That aided by having some intuitive notion of hyperedges, I stumbled upon this formulation of Ray.

        <BR/>

        Which is likely either a rediscovery of concepts in category theory, or an even more general, possibly more easily programmable and reprogrammable (; possibly homoiconic) variant of its ideas. Being this general, quite certainly concepts from all kinds of fields should be phrase-able in this (possibly) more visually intuitive way of manipulating concepts.

        <BR/>

        Though this current setup is quite intuitive to me, I still need to link a lot of it to existing concepts. And quite deliberately, I've not necessarily gone into the details of any particular interpretation/implementation. As this thing is incredibly flexible - and it's not yet at all obvious to me what the resulting implementation will look like.

        <BR/>

        Clearly, I'm trying to be a little far-reaching and extend into any field I could possibly imagine which manages to peak my curiosity. There is much to explore - if only I now had some better tools to apply to everything.
      </Section>
      <Section head="On self-publishing and referencing" sub="Edited personal journeys/histories/... and literary exposure">
        I suspect that this sort of self-(reporting/publishing), necessitates the highlighting of its possible adversarial/game-theoretic properties. With myself and my archives possibly being forgetful or deceitful players, this certainly makes for an interesting dynamic. Consider this quick paragraph as an acknowledgement that I am aware of that, and that I think my attempts aim for accuracy - whether that's actually successful or not -.

        <BR/>

        Similarly, it's worth admitting that I do not necessarily understand/have access to how certain interactions come together in my explorations. I document how I find certain kinds of information in some detail, though this is likely far from exhaustive.

        <BR/>

        I might also fail to mention relevant works (or personal interactions) which have either had impact on my line of thinking more non-trivially, or whose ideas aren't mentioned here, or in my other writing, directly. My current practical approach to this has therefore been to publish many kinds of information I expose myself to (during the time I'm working on these projects). Which hopefully support the more explicit referencing done here. I hope to further expand on this concept in future works.
      </Section>
      <Section head="On language and my bending of it">
        In my - albeit limited - number of orbits around our particular sun, I have found that I myself am (and likely by extension others are) quite inconsistent. Quite regularly I would like to rephrase certain (historical) expressions, dissatisfied by their vagueness or inaccuracy. Or to make the conceptual leap and guess that the only way my memory is even slightly functional is the apparent ability to infer or remember by resolving pointers from context somewhat consistently. A form of permeating uncertain caution seems appropriate when thinking through these abstract concepts: This could be interpreted as a reference carried forward in time with the potential to modify any particular assumption.

        <BR/>

        Additionally, I'm quite certain that my use of language contains a style which is unusual. Likely containing seemingly duplicated word sequences, possibly overly cautious /or not at all, and quite certainly seemingly (possibly on purpose) contradictory in many instances.

        <BR/>

        In this sense, I don't necessarily care about the accuracy of any particular sentence. Whether in this language, or one it's translated to. I care whether the more abstract pattern of ideas which I'm trying to communicate is sufficiently transferred through that language. And the ability to - through time, through correction -, adjust the ideas as deemed by me/you as particularly inconsistent to warrant its change.

        In some sense, several aspects of these arcs could be considered as generalizations of many ideas I've exposed myself to.

In a struggle to understand their/those inconsistencies, I think I found - or am starting to find - a proper language to do so.
